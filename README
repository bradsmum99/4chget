4chget

A super simple bash script to download images from a 4chan thread.  

Usage is simple: copy the url from the browser to the clip board of any 
4chan thread; paste it into the command line like such:

~$ 4chget http://boards.4chan.org/fit/res/4820056 directory_to_dl_to

Optionally, append a name of a directory in which to save the images to.
If the directory name supplied doesn't exist, it will be created. Leave the
dirname argument off, and it will dump the images to the current working
directory.

The script itself runs only on a *NIX environment, and uses the following 
(usually pre-installed) tools:
    bash (or similar)
    curl
    tr
    sed
    grep
    uniq


All work is the original creation of Greg Naughton (C) 2011-, but is placed
into the public domain by whatever license you choose, so long as you keep
the author's name intact, along with the source file.


INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

to install on a unix environment, such as your Mac or Linux box, type:

~$ sudo cp 4chget /usr/bin

That's it. Have fun!  4chan isn't just for Windoze anymore.


TODO

X replace wget with curl since it's more likely to be pre-installed on most
  systems. wget is not. (done)

- an option to download the page text as well, that re-writes the img urls
  to point to the local files.
